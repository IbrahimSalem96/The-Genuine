          <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

          <h2>1. User Eligibility and Account Selection </h2>
          <p>
            Users must select the appropriate account type (Buyer, Seller, Buyer
            & Seller, or Agent) during registration. Incorrect selection without
            notifying The Genuine for rectification may result in account
            suspension or deletion, along with disqualification from offers and
            promotions. The Genuine reserves the right to make this
            determination at its discretion.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Agent Registration Requirement</h2>
          <p>
            Any individual actively engaged in real estate activities must
            register as an Agent. Failure to do so will render any
            agent-specific offers, promotions, or facilities inapplicable. The
            Genuine reserves the right to delete such accounts without liability
            if this condition is not met.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Lifetime Offers</h2>
          <p>
            Lifetime offers provided upon registration are contingent on
            platform engagement within the first 60 days of The Genuine’s
            official launch. To maintain eligibility, Sellers must list at least
            one property, while Buyers must complete at least one property
            purchase through The Genuine within this period. Failure to meet
            these conditions may result in the discontinuation of lifetime
            promotional benefits.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Agent Compliance and Misconduct</h2>
          <p>
            Agents using the The Genuine platform are required to comply with
            all applicable regulations and guidelines set forth by the Dubai
            Land Department (DLD), the Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA), and
            other relevant authorities. Misconduct, including any deviation from
            these standards, will be addressed by The Genuine and may result in
            account suspension or further action.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Prohibited Agent Behavior</h2>
          <p>
            Agents registered with The Genuine must not contact sellers directly
            to solicit private agreements outside of the The Genuine platform.
            Any behavior attempting to circumvent The Genuine’s services,
            including convincing sellers to engage in off-platform transactions,
            will be considered a violation. The Genuine reserves the right to
            impose penalties, pursue damages, and escalate cases to Dubai courts
            if deemed necessary.
          </p>

          <h2>6. User Responsibilities and Prohibited Conduct</h2>
          <p>
            Users agree to provide accurate information, respect other users,
            and refrain from using the platform for any fraudulent or
            inappropriate activities. Misuse of the platform, including
            spamming, posting misleading information, or unrelated content, may
            result in suspension or account termination.
          </p>

          <p>
            By uploading content to the platform, including property listings
            and personal information, users grant The Genuine a license to
            display and use this content. Users are responsible for ensuring the
            legality and accuracy of any information they submit.
          </p>

          <p>

            or integrate with external services. The Genuine does not control or
            endorse these third-party sites and is not responsible for their
            content or services. Users engage with third-party links and
            services at their own risk.

            resulting from events beyond its control, including but not limited

            prevent the fulfillment of obligations.
          </p>

          <h2>15. Termination of Service</h2>
